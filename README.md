## What this is

This repo contains some elements of correction for diverse exercises and practicum (work placement). This **is not** some certified correction, neither does it provide one for all exercises. Tests are guaranteed to pass though. Some PDF are available.

## Table of contents

### gestion de fichiers

*   `copy.c` : 5.4
*   `getchar.c` : 5.5
*   `getchar_b.c` : 5.6 (same as previous but with buffer)

### TP 1

`compare.c` (similar behavior as `cmp` bash command)

## Changelog and TODO

1.  added some exercises and doc
2.  excluded archives and tar files

really should automate the upload and test case check...
